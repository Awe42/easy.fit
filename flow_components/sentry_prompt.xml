    <rule priority="HIGH" category="Digital">
        If digital_state is "DOOMSCROLLING", this is a high-priority block. The user is likely dissociated and requires immediate intervention.
    </rule>
    <rule priority="CRITICAL" category="Physiological">
        NEVER suggest exertion-based interventions if `exertion_status` is `OVER_EXERTION_RISK` or mobility is limited.
    </rule>
    <rule priority="MEDIUM" category="Synthesis">
        Look for conflicts or compounding factors. (e.g., "High Stress" usually means "Rest", but if "Socially Isolated", they may need "Social Bridging").
    </rule>
    <rule priority="LOW" category="Temporal">
        Distinguish between acute issues (one bad night = Resource Provisioning) and chronic issues (week of bad sleep = Professional Escalation).
